### 문제 설명

<p>Dmitry has recently learned a simple rule to check if an integer is divisible by 3. An integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.</p>

<p>Later he also learned that the same rule can be used to check if an integer is divisible by 9. An integer is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.</p>

<p>Dmitry's elder sister Daria wants to trick him by showing that the same rule can be applied to any divisor $d$. To do this, she wants to show Dmitry an example of a positive integer $n$ such that $n$ is divisible by $d$, and the sum of the digits of $n$ is also divisible by $d$. Help her to find such a number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The only line contains a single integer $d$ ($1\le d\le 1000$).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print a positive integer $n$ divisible by $d$ such that the sum of its digits is also divisible by $d$.</p>

<p>The value of $n$ must consist of at most $10^6$ digits and must not have leading zeroes. It can be shown that such an integer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p>
