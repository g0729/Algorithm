### 문제 설명

<p>The Slivians are afraid of factoring; it’s just, well, difficult.</p>

<p>Really, they don’t even care about the factors themselves, just how much they sum to.</p>

<p>We can define F(n) as the sum of all of the factors of n; so F(6) = 12 and F(12) = 28. Your task is, given two integers a and b with a ≤ b, to calculate</p>

<p>\[S=\sum_{a \le n \le b}{F(n)}\]</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing space-separated integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10<sup>12</sup>; b − a ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print S on a single line.</p>
